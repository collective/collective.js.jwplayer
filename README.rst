About JWPlayer
==============

The Web's most advanced Flash and HTML5 video player.

There are host of niche video players on the Internet today. HTML5 has enabled
developers to create simple JavaScript players with ease. But video is complex
and HTML5 makes it even more so. Various streaming protocols, multiple codecs,
captioning requirements and more mean that a simple video player isn't enough.

The JW Player has evolved through the history of online video since its first
version in 2005. The experience developed over those years are built into the
JW Player. Support for all the major CDNs, YouTube, Adobe's Flash Media Server,
Wowza, major advertising networks, analytics providers are just part of what
separate the JW Player from the newcomers.
